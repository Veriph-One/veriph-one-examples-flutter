# Veriph.One Examples: Flutter

Snippets and examples on how to use the Veriph.One SDK for your Flutter projects. All projects included are as minimalistic as possible, using only bare bones elements.

Each folder contains independent and standalone projects that cover specific use cases. Feel free to download only the folder you need or the whole repository if needed.

## Available Samples

1. Android & iOS: A simple flow to capture a phone number safely for the first time, usually helpful for sign up, KYC, and onboarding processes. This example works for apps running on Android and iOS devices. Note: the Android integration uses Kotlin 2.0, if you're relying on outdated or legacy dependencies, use the Android legacy example.
2. Legacy Android: Same implementation as the one before but using Kotlin 1.9 to avoid issues with outdated or legacy dependencies.
